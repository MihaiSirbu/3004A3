The submission is 1 folder which has all the requirements you need. 
You need a video reader to read mp4 files, excel to open the traceability matrix, pdf viewers, txtfile readers, etc. None of it being special software.

You CAN IGNORE build-ECS-Desktop-Debug, build-ECS-Desktop_Qt_5_15_16_MinGW_64_bit-Debug and .git directories, they were for debugging + git. 

Code subfolder contains all the qt code, compiled on the vm.
Diagrams contains sequence diagrams, State diagrams and UML Class diagrams. There is NO state diagram for the elevator control System, as it does NOT have states.

Use cases, Design explanation and Traceability matrix are in the main folder.

Recordings subfolder contains ALL the videos, broken down by categories. Please watch " General explanation/ GUI explanation first ". 

Feel free to test any of the code, or ask me any questions.
